    "panes": [
      {
        "direction": "vertical", 
        "panes": [
          { "command": "nvim" },
          { "command": "npm run dev" }
        ]
      },

  "name": "Editor + Server + Logs",
  "structure": {
    "direction": "vertical",
    "panes": [
      { "command": "nvim" },
      {
        "direction": "horizontal",
        "panes": [
          { "command": "npm start" },

## AI Layout Builder Examples

You can describe layouts in natural language:

- *"Create a layout with nvim on the left and two terminals on the right for running tests and git commands"*
- *"I need a React development setup with editor, dev server, test runner, and git status"*
- *"Make a Python layout with editor on top, interpreter on bottom left, and file watcher on bottom right"*

## Commands Reference

All layout commands are executed in the selected repository directory. Common commands include:

- **Editors**: `nvim`, `code`, `vim`
- **Development**: `npm run dev`, `npm start`, `yarn dev`
- **Testing**: `npm test`, `jest --watch`, `pytest`
- **Version Control**: `git status`, `git log --oneline`
- **Build Tools**: `npm run build`, `make`, `cargo run`
- **Monitoring**: `tail -f logs/app.log`, `htop`
